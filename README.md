_Isn't it strange to find a bubble in the middle of the forest?  
You are camping in the forest, under the darkness of the night, enjoying the silence and getting ready to go to sleep. Suddenly, a strange and luminous bubble appears in front of you and starts moving quickly. Surprised by this event and curious about the bubble's nature, you begin to follow it as it moves deeper into the forest. After a while, however, you realize that your curiosity has led you into a deadly trap. The darkness of the forest hides horrors that prey on its visitors.  
Now you are lost in the middle of nowhere and being hunted by unknown horrors. Following the light of the bubble is your only hope of survival.  
Follow the bubble and don't stray from the light to survive the night... or die._
